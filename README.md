# DTSE Full-Stack Developer assignment - work process

Project is available in 'prediction-assignment' folder.

## Work process

1. installed requirements
2. learning flask
3. set up localhost and required routes ('/' and '/api/prediction')
4. built html page with form on '/' route
5. in main.py figure out which parameters go to joblib
- studied main.py file to understand the process flow
- tested outcomes using sample output parameters
- if a parameter did not provide expected result, I removed it from the code
6. added function to '/api/prediction' that accepts data from javaScript and created dictionary
7. Added table to HTML that takes output from prediction model and adds time stamp
8. Added input validations for HTML form
